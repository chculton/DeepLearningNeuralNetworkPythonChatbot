<p>To use the chatbot, run the startChat.py file in a console. Do note that user input is required to speak to it and <strong>to end the application</strong>.</p>
<p>The above libraries must be installed in order for the model to be trained and/or loaded. <strong>Currently, not all of the required libraries work with Python 3.8. I recommend using Python 3.7 to run this chatbot.</strong></p>

## Default Chatbot Details
The chatbot is named Jekku Poro which is the name of a reindeer which I am personally friends with from Finland. "Poro" is Finnish for reindeer. As a result, the chatbot Jekku speaks better english than the poro Jekku.
